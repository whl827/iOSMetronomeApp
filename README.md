## Inspiration

I was using a simple Google online metrome while doing guitar warm up exercises.
I was manually changing bpm for different exercises and sometimes I forget what tempo I need to play with.
I thought it would be very beneficial to have a metronome app that allows users to save presets for each exercise.
Personally, this could also be useful during the practice time with my band where I need to set my delay tempo for different songs
This app allows you to quickly access various tempo.

## Current Features

1) Sliders to change bpm (range: 30-220)
2) Single tap on Forward/Backward Buttons to increase/decrease the bpm by 1
3) Double tap on Forward/Backward Buttons to increase/decrease the bpm by 5
4) Long Press on Forward/Backward Buttons to increase/decrease the bpm
5) Set your desired subdivision (from 1-8)
5) Add your own songs/exercises with different bpm and recall those bpm whenever needed
